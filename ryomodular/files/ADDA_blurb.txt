- ADC/DAC in one module.
- Converts between continuous voltage and 8bit digital encoding using voltage control based on the same design as our VC Sequencer.
- All analogue circuitry - no software or micro processors!
- All low latency CMOS and Opamp circuitry!
- Commonly controlled yet separate ins and outs.
- Schmitt trigger inputs.
- Slim 14HP footprint.
- Compact ??mm Depth (with power cable attached).
- Low power draw: ??mA+12V / ?mA -12V /?mA +5V.
- Works for audio as well as CV.
- Fast responding CV inputs allow clocking to reach through entire audio range.
