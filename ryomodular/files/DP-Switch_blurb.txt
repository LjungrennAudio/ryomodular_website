- Patch programmable switching tool - a veritable swiss-army knife of logic.
- Schmitt trigger input conditioning allows triggering by any voltage or shape of input signal.
- All analogue circuitry. 
- Slim 6HP footprint.
- Compact 45mm Depth (with power cable attached).
- Low power draw: 12mA+12V / 0mA -12V /0mA +5V.
- Input/Outputs cope with audio, CV or trig/gate to ultrasonic speeds upto rail max voltages.
- Momentary and latching modes.
- Can be combined via patch-programming to produce more complex toggles, latches and flip-flops.
