penta

stepped oscillator
by clocking Penta at audio rates, you can create stepped waveforms

variation
the odd step numbers of Penta allow you to create ever-evolving variation in sync with your sequences. use it to modulate a waveshaper or filter!

Ratcheting
Use Penta to control an LFO's rate in time with your sequence to create variable ratcheting per step!

Clock division
by setting the knobs to only max or minimum, you can create a divider, cutting the clock down to slower speeds based on odd divisions - great for polyrhythms!
