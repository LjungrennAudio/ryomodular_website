trig expander

Variable sequence lengths
patch an output to the reset input of VC SEQ to make shorter sequences. This can allow you to create odd step numbers, useful for creating polyrhythms, ever-evolving variation, or bit-reduced oscillations when clocked at audio rate.

Trigger envelopes per step
using the bottom-most trigger output, or any OR'd combination of outputs, you can trigger envelopes, samples, etc in time with the sequence

Drum sequencing
combine multiple outputs with RYO (N)OR to trigger drums in time with the sequence

Sync VCOs
a single trigger to a VCO or set of VCOs will reset their phase - great for creating swells per step or set of steps through phase differences caused by detuning of separate VCOs!
