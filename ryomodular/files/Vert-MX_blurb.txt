- 3-channel attenuverting high precision mixer/attenuvertor.
- Works as 3 channel mixer, 1 attenuvertor + 2 channel mixer, 3 attenuvertors.
- -1.0x to 1.0x gain (-5V to +5V offset available) per channel, channels can be chained for greater offset gain, any combination of channels in any order. (+/-10V offset max)
- 5.0V offset per channel.
- All analogue circuitry.
- Hi-fidelity signal chain with low noise opamps.
- High impedance inputs and buffered outputs.
- Slim 6HP footprint.
- Compact 35mm Depth (with power cable attached).
- Low power draw: 22mA+12V / 22mA -12V /no +5V required.
- Works for audio as well as CV.
- Fast responding CV inputs allow for complex modulation and modulating with audio signals.
- Sum mix output.
- Ch1 and ch2 outputs normalized to mix output for patching convenience.
